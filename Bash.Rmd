# File handling

## Batch renaming for many files

```{bash}
# First do a testrun, if the mv command looks correct! For a live run, remove the echo in fron of mv
for i in *fastq.gz; do echo mv "$i" "${i/L001/L003}"; done
```

Here, `${i/L001/L003}` replaces the first occurrence of L001 with L003`

## Moving files to Allas
For movinf files to allas, I use the swift protocol. To copy files, I use those commands:

For that, I first configure allas for the suited project and then navigacte into the folder which files I would like to add to the bucket and then use rclone to copy the files

```
module load allas
allas-conf
rclone copy . allas:MC_RNASeq_Novaseq --progress
```
